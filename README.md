> ⚙️  A modern rewrite of [Henrik Joreteg](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg)'s [github-secret-keeper](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/github-secret-keeper)

* * *

## About

The original project from Henrik is great, but kinda _dated_, and I want to develop my own version to test some packages and solutions, and run it on serverless solutions.

> 👉 **NOTE:** the idea and the code has been reimplemented as [becodeorg/oto](https://github.com/becodeorg/oto).
